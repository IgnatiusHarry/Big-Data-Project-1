Analysis of Taiwan Presidential Elections (2000 vs. 2024)

**Project Description**

This project aims to analyze changes in Taiwan's political alignment by comparing the partisan characteristics of electoral regions in the 2000 and 2024 presidential elections. This analysis will include aggregating vote counts at the district level, calculating vote share percentages, and examining the correlation between vote shares across the two elections.

**Data**

The data consists of village-level voting results from Taiwan's 2000 and 2024 presidential elections with 15429 of total observations. The data includes variables such as the number of votes received by the DPP, KMT, and other candidates, the number of valid votes, and the number of voters.

**Methodology**

> Data Cleaning and Preparation:_

> Combine village-level data files into single dataframes for 2000 and 2024.

> Aggregate data at the district level for both elections.

_Data Analysis:_

> Merge the aggregated data from 2000 and 2024.

> Calculate vote share percentages for KMT, DPP, and other candidates.

> Compute Pearson correlation coefficients between vote shares in 2000 and 2024.


**Data Visualization:**

Created scatter plots to visualize correlations between vote shares.

**Results**

The results include aggregated vote counts, vote share percentages, Pearson correlation coefficients, and scatter plots. The analysis reveals insights into the stability and changes in political alignment in Taiwan over 24 years.
